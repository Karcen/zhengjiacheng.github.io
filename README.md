## 🧑‍🎓 About Me

🎓 I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in **Bioengineering** at the Marine College of Shandong University. Prior to this, I studied **Chemical Engineering** at Dalian University of Technology (2019–2021).  

💻 I have engaged in data science research as a research assistant at the *Institute of International Studies*, Shandong University, under the mentorship of [Dr. Jamal Khan](https://iis.wh.sdu.edu.cn/info/1216/2395.htm) and [Prof. Yuan Li](https://esnea.wh.sdu.edu.cn/info/1024/1208.htm).  

🌱 From May to August 2024, I joined the *Climate Change Economics and Low Carbon Transition* team at *University College London*, supervised by [Prof. Zhifu Mi](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/people/dr-zhifu-mi) and [Dr. Haoran Zhang](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8751-5407), contributing to the development of the **IPCC database**.  

🤖 Additionally, I worked as a Research Intern in the *Hong Kong General AI (HKGAI)* project at *The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology*, helping deploy the HKGAI large model for the Hong Kong government in collaboration with [Jiaming Ji](https://jijiaming.com/) and [Boyuan Chen](https://cby-pku.github.io/).
