## 🚀 About Me
Thank you for visiting my GitHub. I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Bioengineering at the Marine College of Shandong University. Prior to this, I studied Chemical Engineering at Dalian University of Technology from 2019 to 2021.

I have engaged in data science research as a research assistant at the Institute of International Studies, Shandong University, working under the mentorship of Dr. [Jamal Khan](https://iis.wh.sdu.edu.cn/info/1216/2395.htm)  and Prof. [Yuan Li](https://esnea.wh.sdu.edu.cn/info/1024/1208.htm).

From May to August 2024, I was part of the Climate Change Economics and Low Carbon Transition team at University College London, supervised by Prof. [Zhifu Mi](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/people/dr-zhifu-mi) and Dr. [Haoran Zhang](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8751-5407) During this time, I contributed to the development of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) database. Additionally, I worked as a Research Intern at the Hong Kong General AI (HKGAI) project, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I helped deploy the HKGAI large model for the Hong Kong government. This involved collaborating with [Jiaming Ji](https://jijiaming.com/) and [Boyuan Chen](https://cby-pku.github.io/) from Peking University on data alignment.

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please feel free to contact me via [email](karcenzheng17@gmail.com).
