                <p>
                    Thank you for taking the time to read my website. I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Bioengineering at Marine College, Shandong University. Previously, I studied chemical engineering at Dalian University
                    of Technology from 2019 to 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have participated in data science research as a research assistant at the Institute of International Studies, Shandong University, under the guidance of Dr.
                    <a href="https://iis.wh.sdu.edu.cn/info/1216/2395.htm" target="_blank">Jamal Khan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://esnea.wh.sdu.edu.cn/info/1024/1208.htm" target="_blank">Yuan Li</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was a member of the Climate Change Economics and Low Carbon Transition team from 2024.05-2024.08 under the supervision of Prof.
                    <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/people/dr-zhifu-mi" target="_blank"> Zhifu Mi</a> and Dr.<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8751-5407" target="_blank"> Haoran Zhang</a> at University College London
                    where I contributed to the development of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) database. Now I am a Research Intern in HKGAI, The Hongkong University of Science and Technology, deploying the HKGAI large model for the Hong Kong government, collaborating with <a herf="https://jijiaming.com/">Jiaming Ji</a> and <a herf="https://cby-pku.github.io/">Boyuan Chen</a> from Peking University in data alignment.
