        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website :). I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a major in bioengineering at Marine College, Shandong University. Prior to this, I pursued studies in chemical engineering at Dalian University of Technology from 2019 to 2021. From 2022 to 2023, I have been selected to participate in the double degree experimental class of International Politics + International Economics and Trade at School of Northeast Asia Studies, Shandong University. During this period, I have actively engaged in research focused on the field of economics at Institute of International Studies, Shandong University. Additionally, I am a member of Chinese Society of Optimization, Overall Planning and Economical Mathematics as well as Beijing Society of Image and Graphics. Here is my <a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0003-1318-7986">ORCID</a>. For any inquiries, please feel free to contact me via <a href="karcen_zheng@mail.sdu.edu.cn"> email</a>.
