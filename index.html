        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website :). I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a major in bioengineering at Marine College, Shandong University. Prior to this, I pursued studies in chemical engineering at Dalian University of Technology from 2019 to 2021. From 2022 to 2023, I have been selected to participate in the double degree experimental class of International Politics + International Economics and Trade at School of Northeast Asia Studies, Shandong University. During this period, I have actively engaged in policy-related economic research at Institute of International Studies, Shandong University as a researcher assistant, under the supervisor of outstanding postdoctoral fellow Dr.Jamal Khan and distinguished Professor Yuan Li. Additionally, I am a member of Climate Change Economics and Low Carbon Transition team at University College London(under the supervision of Prof.Zhifu Mi), Chinese Society of Optimization, Overall Planning and Economical Mathematics as well as Beijing Society of Image and Graphics. Here is my <a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0003-1318-7986">ORCID</a>. For any inquiries, please feel free to contact me via <a href="karcen_zheng@mail.sdu.edu.cn"> email</a>.
