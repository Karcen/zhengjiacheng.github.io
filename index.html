			<section>
				<p>Thank you for visiting my website. I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Bioengineering at the Marine College of Shandong University. Prior to this, I studied Chemical Engineering at Dalian University of Technology from 2019 to 2021.</p>
				<p>I have engaged in data science research as a research assistant at the Institute of International Studies, Shandong University, working under the mentorship of Dr. <a href="https://iis.wh.sdu.edu.cn/info/1216/2395.htm" target="_blank">Jamal Khan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://esnea.wh.sdu.edu.cn/info/1024/1208.htm" target="_blank">Yuan Li</a>.</p>
				<p>From May to August 2024, I was part of the Climate Change Economics and Low Carbon Transition team at University College London, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/people/dr-zhifu-mi" target="_blank">Zhifu Mi</a> and Dr. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8751-5407" target="_blank">Haoran Zhang</a>. During this time, I contributed to the development of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) database. Additionally, I worked as a Research Intern at the Hong Kong General AI (HKGAI) project, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I helped deploy the HKGAI large model for the Hong Kong government. This involved collaboration with <a href="https://jijiaming.com" target="_blank">Jiaming Ji</a> and <a href="https://cby-pku.github.io" target="_blank">Boyuan Chen</a> from Peking University on data alignment.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:karcenzheng17@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
